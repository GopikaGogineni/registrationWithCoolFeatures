# registrationWithCoolFeatures
The main idea of this project is to develop a registration form with some features. When the user clicks on Create Account/ Save to Local and Session Button, the JavaScript object will be converted to JSON string, function is called to read from JSON string and also the functions to save to local and session storage are called. Some of the features of this form include:
1. Online and Offline Events: When the user is connected to the internet, the Online Event is triggered. Similarly, when the user is NOT connected to the internet, the Offline Event is triggered.
2. Phone Number Validation: If the phone number doesn't match the pattern in regex, then an alert is shown.
3. Email Id Validation: An alert will be displayed using regex if the user enters an invalid email id format and so on
Some of the other features also include reading from JSON string, saving to local and session storage, reading from local storage, reading from session storage, reading from session storage after the browser is closed and page is reloaded and checking the password strength and password match.
